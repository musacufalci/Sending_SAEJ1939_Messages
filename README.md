# Sending_SAEJ1939_CANBUS_Messages

- Reading CAN messages with different PGNs such as vehicle speed, fuel level, engine_speed etc. in the J1939 standard
- Microcontroller: NXP LPC11C24F
- CAN BAUD RATE: 500 kbit/s
- PCAN-View program
- The  SAE J1939/16 document outlines the methods used to detect the baud rate of an SAE J1939 network segment by ECUs that can adjust their CAN baud rate while in use. The specified approach provides a reliable method to detect the CAN baud rate of that network segment without interrupting network communications.
